# automated-build
testing an automated building using dockerfiles on github

testing

test1: pushed a Dockerfile which successfully triggered an auto-build.
test2: adding a line to readme file to see if the commit triggers a auto-build.
test2 result: anything could trigger a build. But what happens if I have multiple Dockerfiles, say, A/Dockerfile and B/Dockerfile?
